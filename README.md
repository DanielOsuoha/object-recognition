# Object Detection with Python and OpenCV

## Description
This project is a simple object detection application written in Python using the OpenCV library. The application detects objects of interest in images or video streams, such as faces, cars, or pedestrians.

## Features
- Basic object detection using OpenCV.
- Support for detecting various types of objects.
- Easy-to-use interface for loading images or video streams.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the OpenCV library installed. You can install OpenCV using pip:
pip install opencv-python

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script `object_detection.py`.
4. Follow the instructions in the console to load an image or video stream and perform object detection.

## Object Detection Methods
- **Haar Cascades**: A classical method for object detection based on machine learning.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Pre-trained deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).
- **Custom-trained Models**: Train your own models for specific object detection tasks.

## Sample Images and Videos
You can find sample images and videos in the `samples` folder. Use these samples to test the object detection capabilities of the application.
